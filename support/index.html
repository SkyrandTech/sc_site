                  Prices and availability of products on the Site are subject to change without notice. Errors will be corrected when discovered. Despite our best efforts, the products listed on our Site may be outdated. We will normally verify prices as part of our dispatch procedures so that, where a product's current price is less than our stated price, we will charge the lower amount when dispatching the product to you. If a product's current price is higher than the price stated on our Site, we will normally, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before dispatching the product, or reject your order and notify you of such rejection. We are under no obligation to provide the product to you at the outdated (lower) price, even after we have sent you an Order Receipt Confirmation or Payment Receipt, if the pricing error could have reasonably been recognized by you as a pricing error.<br>

                  On occasion, you may be able to place a product in your shopping cart and submit your order for processing, but your order is subsequently canceled due to the unavailability of product. You acknowledge that products may be sold quickly and there may be a short time gap after an order has been submitted, but where the product is no longer available. You agree that we may cancel your order after you have received an Order Receipt Confirmation or a Payment Receipt without penalty. On very rare occasions, you may receive a Shipping Confirmation from us, but the product is no longer available in our or our third party fulfillment provider's inventory.
